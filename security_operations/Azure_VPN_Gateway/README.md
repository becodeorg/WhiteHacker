With COVID 19 and the sanitary measures, most of our employees are working from home. Meaning that our security hardly depends on the connection you're employees are using. If some are working on public WiFi it might be a serious security issue. To encounter it, we will encrypt the data and secure the connection point to point by setting up a VPN connection.
