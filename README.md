## The content of your course

BeCode promotes a learning experience based on projects rather than lessons. With this in mind the content of this course has been divided in several categories of challenges, resources and other tools aimed at teaching specific sets of skills.

The content will be split in 5 modules spread over 20 days of training:

- [Identities and Access](./identityAccess/README.md)
- [Logging and Monitoring](./Monitoring/README.md)
- [Security Operations](./security_operations/README.md)
- [Secure Data and Apps](./dataEncryption/README.md)
- [Incident Response](./incidentResponse/README.md)
- [Hackathon](./hackathon/README.md)

The whole course will be around a practical use case of the company "Becloud". Here you will find a list of the employees and their roles in this company. Our goal by the end of this learning path will be to build a complete cloud infrastructure allowing secure data sharing & management.

The slides used to present the course are available [here](./slides/README.md)

We hope you have fun during this training. Let's start !
