Type of challenge : **Learning/Practice** <br />
Duration : **2 days** <br />
Team Challenge : **solo/group** <br />

## Preamble
Data protection and security is a fundamental requirement when deploying resources in Microsoft Azure. As an administrator, you need to understand the shared responsibility model for Microsoft Azure, and how to protect your data in transit and at rest.  In this brief, you will learn about the various security options that exist within Microsoft Azure, and how to apply different levels of encryption to the data at rest in your Azure resources such as :

- [Azure Storage Service Encryption](./Azure%20Storage%20Service%20Encryption/README.md)
- [Azure Disk Encryption For Azure VMs](./Azure%20Disk%20Encryption%20For%20Azure%20VMs/README.md)
- [Azure Key Rotation](./Azure%20Key%20Rotation/README.md)

  
By the end of this course, you will be ready to implement data encryption at rest for multiple services in your Azure environment.
