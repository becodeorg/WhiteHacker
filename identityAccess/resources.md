## Your mission

Becloud now needs to deploy resources that will be used internally by the employees.
Since Becloud is a complete fake, you are free to choose the resources that you're going to manage. I would suggest you to choose resources in the scope of your actual job or the position you foresee.

### Instructions
- Part 1 :
    - Check the [list of resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=featured) provided by Azure
    - Choose one resource (or a group of resources) to setup and check the documentation to plan your actions (check in the inspiration list below)
    - Check with the coach if it is OK to deploy
- Part 2 :
    - Create a subscription with your free trial
    - Deploy the resources

### Inspiration 

Here are some examples of resources that might interest you to deploy :
- Remote desktop
- Virtual machine
- WebApp
- Web API
- Database
