Duration : **3 hours**

Team Challenge : **solo**

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to :
- Create a custom role
- Assign a role

## Your mission

Becloud is growing fast! We are now able to add new users and ensure that they can securely login to Azure. We will need some help in order to support our users if an issue happen. If we want our support team to help our users, they will need to get permissions to our Azure administration, but we don't want them to access everything, only what they will need.

We want the support team to be able to :

- Create support request tickets
- View resource groups

### Instructions

* Check existing roles in Azure AD
* Check if there is already an existing one corresponding to our request
* Try to create a role from scratch and test it

### To go further

* Try to create the same role with ARM templates
