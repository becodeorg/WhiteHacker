# Organization

Type of challenge : **Learning/Practice**
Duration : **2 hours**
Team Challenge : **solo**

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to :
- Create an organization

## Your mission

The first step when you create a new company, is to create a directory containing all users, groups, services that you would need to manage. It's called an organization. It will help your cloud provider to know that all resources created under a given organization will be owned by the organization.

I would strongly suggest that you double check the documentation linked in the trusty resources to know more about organizations on Azure and AWS.

Since Azure is completely new for most of you, I would like you start a spreadsheet to take note of each words that you don't understand and to keep track of the sources that you used to understand those. We will discuss together the words and the sources that you used to understand what they mean.
### Instructions
