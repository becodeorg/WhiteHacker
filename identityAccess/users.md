# Users creation

Type of challenge : **Learning**

Duration : **6 hours**

Team Challenge : **solo**

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to :

- Explain what a cloud identity is
- Explain what an external user is
- Create users
- Create groups
- Create dynamic groups
- Create external users
- Restore a deleted user (Azure only)
## Your mission

The startup Becloud is a company providing cloud services to other companies. It has just been founded. You will be in charge of building the cloud infrastructure on which will rely their services.

In this first part, we will ask you to build the basis of any organization which is users and groups.

Since users will be our base to work with, be as much precise as possible to avoid any typo or error. Make things right from start!

As for the previous briefing, I'll ask you to grow your list of words ;)

### Instructions

* Create the users reported in the CSV file
* Create the groups corresponding to the roles reported in the CSV file
* Create external users with your coachs emails (pierre-yves.dehon@becode.org, ...)
* Now delete a user that you just created, and try to restore it (Azure only)
* Create a "Dynamic User" group that will contain every users in your tenant

### Going further

* If you're already experienced with user management, try to do a script that takes the CSV file and automagically creates the users and groups in your favorite cloud provider.
